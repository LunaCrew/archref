## Introduction

LunaCrew is a software development team that specializes in building web applications using modern technologies. As part of its development process, LunaCrew develops and maintains npm packages that are used across its projects. These packages include utilities, libraries, and frameworks that help to streamline development and improve code quality.

This document outlines the reference architecture for **LunaCrew's** npm packages, including the high-level architecture, design principles, package structure, dependencies, testing, documentation, versioning, and publishing.

## Architecture Overview

The reference architecture for **LunaCrew's** npm packages is based on the following principles:

- **Modularity**: Each npm package should be self-contained and have a clear purpose. Packages should be small and focused, with minimal dependencies.

- **Reusability**: Packages should be designed to be reusable across projects. They should be easy to integrate with other packages and should follow best practices for modularity and encapsulation.

- **Testability**: Packages should be well-tested, with a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover all functionality. Tests should be automated and run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Documentation**: Packages should be well-documented, with clear and concise API documentation that explains how to use the package and what each function does.

- **Versioning**: Packages should follow semantic versioning (semver) to ensure that changes are backward-compatible and that users can easily upgrade to new versions.

- **Publishing**: Packages should be published to the npm registry and should follow best practices for versioning, tagging, and publishing.

## Design Principles

The design principles that **LunaCrew's** npm packages should follow are as follows:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each package should have a single responsibility and should do one thing well. Packages should be small and focused, with minimal dependencies.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Packages should be open for extension but closed for modification. Packages should be designed to be easily extended and customized without modifying the core functionality.

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Packages should follow the DRY principle and avoid duplicating code. Reusable code should be extracted into separate modules or packages.

- **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)**: Packages should follow the KISS principle and be simple and easy to understand. Complexity should be minimized, and code should be easy to read and maintain.

## Package Structure

The recommended package structure for **LunaCrew's** npm packages is as follows:

```md
package-name/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── module1.ts
│   ├── module2.ts
├── test/
│   ├── module1.spec.ts
│   ├── module2.spec.ts
|── README.md
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
```

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the package, including the main entry point (index.ts) and any additional modules.
- **test/**: Contains the unit tests for the package, including one test file for each module.
- **README.md**: File with an overview of the package and an API.md file with detailed API documentation.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the package, including the name, version, dependencies, and scripts.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

## Dependencies

**LunaCrew's** npm packages should have minimal dependencies and should only depend on packages that are necessary for the package to function. Dependencies should be specified in the package.json file and should be pinned to specific versions to ensure that the package is reproducible.

## Testing

**LunaCrew's** npm packages should be well-tested, with a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover all functionality. Tests should be written using a testing framework such as Jest or Mocha and should be automated using a CI/CD pipeline.

## Documentation

**LunaCrew's** npm packages should be well-documented, with clear and concise API documentation that explains how to use the package and what each function does. Documentation should be written in Markdown format and should be included in the docs/ directory of the package.

## Versioning

**LunaCrew's** npm packages should follow semantic versioning (semver) to ensure that changes are backward-compatible and that users can easily upgrade to new versions. Version numbers should be specified in the package.json file and should follow the format major.minor.patch.

## Publishing

**LunaCrew's** npm packages should be published to the npm registry and should follow best practices for versioning, tagging, and publishing. Packages should be published using the npm publish command and should be tagged with the appropriate version number.

## Conclusion

This document has outlined the reference architecture for **LunaCrew's** npm packages, including the high-level architecture, design principles, package structure, dependencies, testing, documentation, versioning, and publishing. By following these guidelines, LunaCrew can ensure that its npm packages are well-designed, well-tested, and easy to use.
